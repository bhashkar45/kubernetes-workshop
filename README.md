# Kubernetes Workshop

Welcome to Kubernetes! We love you!

### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.
Kubernetes builds upon [15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444), combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
