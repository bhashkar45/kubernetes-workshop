# 1) Getting Minikube to start

The first goal is to get the `minikube start` command working on your local machine.

The tutorial to follow to get this accomplished can be found [here](/tutorials/getting-up-and-running/minikube/README.md)

# 2) Get comfortable with kubectl

# 3) YAML files are a thing

# 4) Let's write an app and deploy it to Kubernetes

Let's find some code to deploy. We'll write a Deployment and reference the container image for the app we just created.
